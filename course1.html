            applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions
            of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and
            network-centric language that can be used as a platform initself. It is a fast, secure, reliable

        <dd><p>-Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[65] and metaobjects).[66] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[67][68] and logic programming.[69]
        Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[70] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
