        <p>-Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web
            applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions
            of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and
            network-centric language that can be used as a platform initself. It is a fast, secure, reliable
            programming language for coding everything from mobile apps
            and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.</p>

        <p>C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level, general-purpose programming
            language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an
            extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern
            C++
            currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for
            low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many
            vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
            Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.</p>

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to
            simplify
            the process of making web pages presentable.CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page.
            Using CSS, you can control the color of the text,the style of fonts, the spacing between
            paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, whatbackground images or colors are used, layout
            designs,variations in display for different devices andscreen sizes as well as a variety of
            other effects.CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
            presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML
            or XHTML.</p>

        <p>PHP is an HTML-embedded, server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is also
            used as a general purpose programming language. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and
            appeared in the market in 1995. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, C++, and Java.
            PHP codes are simply mixed with HTML codes and can be used in combination with various web
            frameworks. Its scripts are executed on the server. PHP code is processed by a PHP interpreter.
            The main goal of PHP is to allow web developer to create dynamically generated pages quickly.
            A PHP file consists of texts, HTML tags and scripts with a file extension of .php, .php3, or
            .phtml. You can create a login page, design a form, create forums, dynamic and static websites
            and many more with PHP. </p>
