                <p>Worldwide, experts estimate that people consume around 2.25 billion cups of coffee per day.
                    Researchers have looked at the benefits of drinking coffee for conditions such as diabetes,
                    cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. There is evidence to support
                    some, but not all, of these claims.
                    Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin
                    B3), magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest
                    that these and other ingredients in coffee can benefit the human body in various ways.

                    benefits, and the risks of drinking coffee.</p>
