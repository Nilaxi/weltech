                    There are 4 types of coffee bean. Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa and Liberica.
                    Where do coffee beans come from?
                    Coffee beans come from the coffee plant, a bush-like plant which can get very tall (coffee farmers
                    will
                    usually keep them trimmed to around 5ft to keep them manageable). On these coffee plants, bunches of
                    cherries grow and it’s inside these that you’ll find two coffee beans.

                    On average, it takes around one year for the coffee plant to begin to produce fragrant, white
                    flowers,
                    then up to four years later before it begins to bear fruit. However, it’ll be around 10 years for
                    these
                    plants to begin producing coffee beans on a commercial level, which are the ones of the most value
                    to
                    the farmers. The general lifespan of the coffee plant will be between 30 to 40 years but they can
                    live
                    much longer depending on the care given!

                    Once they’re ripe and ready for picking they’ll turn red in colour, but it takes a keen eye to know
                    when
                    the berries are ready for harvest as picking too early or too late can have a huge impact on the
                    final
                    taste.

                Where is coffee grown?
                Most coffee plants are grown around what’s known as ‘the bean belt’, an area around the equator between
                the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer. It’s here that’s home to the coffee capitals of the world such as
                Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia and Ethiopia, as these are the locations that coffee’s given the
                perfect growing conditions to thrive.

                Interestingly, the location of where coffee beans are grown can alter the taste. Things such as climate,
                elevation and even soil type can impact the flavour of the coffee the beans produce.
